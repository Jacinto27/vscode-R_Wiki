## vscode-R

Install
[vscode-R](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r) in VS
Code by searching `ikuyadeu.r` in extension marketplace.

If your R installation is from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html),
then the default settings should work out of the box. Otherwise, you may have to
change `r.rterm.linux` to the path to your R executable, which will be executed
on command `Create R Terminal`.

## languageserver

[languageserver](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) is an
implementation of the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
for R.

Run the following commands in R.

You may install the latest stable release from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("languageserver")
```

or install the development version with the newest features:

```r
remotes::install_github("REditorSupport/languageserver")
```

You can also install the `rmarkdown` package and Pandoc rendering library to see
formatted R help pages upon [hover](#hover). Previews of function documentation
without these dependencies will show a plain page.

`rmarkdown` can be installed with:

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Pandoc is
[automatically installed](https://alexd106.github.io/intro2R/install_rmarkdown.html)
if you have RStudio on your machine. See the official installation guide
[here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) if you do not have RStudio.

## radian

[radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) is highly recommended as the R
terminal for interactive use. It requires Python which should be available on
most Linux distributions out of the box.

To install it globally:

```bash
pip install -U radian
```

Or if you don't have root privilege, you may want to install it only for
yourself:

```bash
pip install --user radian
```

You may run `which radian` to see where your `radian` executable is located.

Then the following VS Code settings should be updated to properly use radian as
the default terminal. If your `radian` is installed only for `user`:

```json
{
  "r.bracketedPaste": true,
  "r.rterm.linux": "/home/user/.local/bin/radian"
}
```
