## Install

1. Install yarn and Node.js
1. Install Visual Studio Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R.git
cd vscode-R
yarn install # install required packages for vscode-R
code . # run VS Code
```

## Test

- In VS Code: 'File' -> 'Open Folder...' and select 'vscode-R' (the directory
  with your edits)
- Press `F5`
- A new VS Code window should open, with '[Extension Development Host]' in the
  title bar. This is running your modified version of vscode-R

## Lint

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting our sources. You can run eslint
across the sources by calling yarn eslint from a terminal or command prompt.

To lint the source as you make changes, you can install the
[eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
