collaboration. The workspace viewer, data view, plots, and browsers are
available to guests through the host session. To enable this feature, _both_ the
host and guest must have this extension and session watcher enabled.

Hosts can control the level of access guests have through the provided Live
Share Control view. This provides the following controls:

- Whether guests can access the current R session and its workspace
- Whether R commands should be forwarded from the guest to the host terminal
  (bypasses terminal permissions)
- Whether opened R browsers should be shared with guests
