Plot could be displayed in a VS Code editor tab.

## PNG file

When R session watcher is enabled, the default behavior of displaying graphics
is to replay the plots to a `png` device created over a temporary PNG file.
Whenever the plot is updated, the PNG file is revealed in VS Code in an image
viewer.

There are known limitations of PNG plot viewer:

- If the plot contains multiple pages (e.g. `par(mfrow =)` is used), then the
  last page will overwrite the previous pages.
- If the code has multiple plot calls, each creating a new plot, then only the
  last plot will be captured.
- Some plot code based on `grid` package may not work as the plot updates cannot
  be captured.

## Native plot window

If the PNG plot viewer is not working properly, one might want to disable it
with the following code in `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
options(vsc.plot = FALSE)
```

Then the plot viewer will fall back to the native plot window. It only takes
effect on R session startup.

## SVG in httpgd plot viewer

[httpgd](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd) is an R package to provide a graphics
device that asynchronously serves SVG graphics via HTTP and WebSockets. Before
using httpgd, install the package via

```r
install.packages("httpgd")
```

vscode-R supports an SVG plot viewer based on httpgd. Enable `r.plot.useHttpgd`
in VS Code settings.

Then whenever a plot is created, a Plot viewer tab will be revealed where a
number of httpgd features are natively supported.

The httpgd plot viewer supports auto-resizing, light/dark theme mode, plot
history, hiding and zoomming.

## SVG in httpgd webpage

To show the original httpgd viewer in a webpage in VS Code, put the following
code in `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
if (interactive() && Sys.getenv("RSTUDIO") == "") {
  Sys.setenv(TERM_PROGRAM = "vscode")
  if ("httpgd" %in% .packages(all.available = TRUE)) {
    options(vsc.plot = FALSE)
    options(device = function(...) {
      httpgd::hgd(silent = TRUE)
      .vsc.browser(httpgd::hgd_url(history = FALSE), viewer = "Beside")
    })
  }
  source(file.path(Sys.getenv(
    if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") "USERPROFILE" else "HOME"
  ), ".vscode-R", "init.R"))
}
```

The httpgd web page supports live update on resizing, history navigation,
zooming, save as svg/png/pdf and some other formats.
