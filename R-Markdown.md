## Knitting R Markdown documents

R Markdown documents can be knit in a VSCode-R managed background process when
using the knit command. Beyond the use of a background process, this has the
following features:

- Set knitr document directory
- Knit progress tracking
- Smart knitting

### Set knitr document directory

By default, knitr evaluates documents as though they are the root folder. For
instance, calling `source` in a document will use the document's folder as the
working directory, not the document's workspace. This can be modified in
VSCode-R, so as to tell knitr if we want to evaluate from the workspace root or
the document directory.

### Progress tracking

Knit progress is tracked via a progress bar, and can be viewed in the R Markdown
output stream. Progress is determined by the percentages reported in the R
Markdown output stream and may not be 100% accurate.

### Smart knitting

The knit button is "smart" in that it checks the document and its workspace for
context when knitting. For instance, if a document has a knit function defined
in the YAML header, the knit button will call the custom function when knitting.
This also works for R Markdown sites, where the knit button will call
`rmarkdown::render_site` instead of `rmarkdown::render`.

## Live rendering R Markdown documents

You can live preview R Markdown documents by pressing the "Open Preview to Side"
button when focused on a R Markdown document.

You can also preview a document by right-clicking it in the explorer and
selecting preview.

You can also run the following code and a browser viewer will open with live
rendering of the R Markdown document.

```r
rmarkdown::run("your-rmd-document.Rmd")
```
