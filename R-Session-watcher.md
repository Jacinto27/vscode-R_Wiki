R session watcher enables the communication between vscode-R and a live R
session to support the following features:

- Watch any R session
- Show value of session symbols on hover
- Provide completion for session symbols
- `View()` any objects including data frames and list objects
- Show plot output on update and plot history
- Show htmlwidgets, documentation and shiny apps in WebView

### Basic usage

To enable this feature, turn on `r.sessionWatcher` in VSCode settings, reload or
restart VSCode, and the session watcher will be activated automatically on R
sessions launched by vscode-R via `R: Create R Terminal` command.

_If you previously appended the `source(...)` line to `~/.Rprofile`, you may
safely remove it since the configuration for basic usage is automated. It is now
only necessary for advanced usage described below._

### Advanced usage (for self-managed R sessions)

For advanced users to work with self-managed R sessions (e.g. manually launched
R terminal or started in `tmux` or `screen` window), some extra configuration is
needed. Follow the steps below to make R session watcher work with any external
R session:

1. Turn on `r.sessionWatcher` in VSCode settings.
2. Edit `.Rprofile` in your home directory by running the following code in R:

   ```r
   file.edit("~/.Rprofile")
   ```

3. Append the following code to the file:

   ```r
    source(file.path(Sys.getenv(
      if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") "USERPROFILE" else "HOME"
    ), ".vscode-R", "init.R"))
   ```

4. Restart or Reload Window in VSCode

If the workspace folder you open in VSCode already has a `.Rprofile`, you need
to append the code above in this file too because `~/.Rprofile` will not be
executed when a local `.Rprofile` is found.

The script only works with environment variable `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode`. the
script will not take effect with R sessions started in a `tmux` or `screen`
window that does not have it, unless this environment variable is manually set
before sourcing `init.R`, for example, you may insert a line
`Sys.setenv(TERM_PROGRAM="vscode")` before it.

### Available functions and options

When the session watcher is initialized on session startup, a local environment
named `tools:vscode` is attached and the following functions are made available
for user to interoperate with VSCode:

```r
# Attach vscode-R with same workspace folder to current session.
.vsc.attach()

# A customizable View() where title and viewer can be specified.
.vsc.view(x, title, viewer)

# Browse an URL in a WebView (used by e.g. shiny apps, R html help).
.vsc.browser(url, title, ..., viewer)

# Show viewer from a HTML file or htmlwidget object (used by most htmlwidgets).
.vsc.viewer(url, title, ..., viewer)

# Show page viewer from a HTML file or htmlwidget object (used by e.g. profvis).
.vsc.page_viewer(url, title, ..., viewer)
```

All WebView-related functions have a `viewer` argument which could be one of the
values defined in
[vscode-api#ViewColumn](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ViewColumn),
.e.g. `"Active"` (current editor), `"Two"` (editor group 2), or `"Besides"`
(always show besides the current editor).

The following options are available for user to customize the session watcher
functionality and behavior:

```r
# Watch global environemnt symbols to provide hover-on and
#   completion-after session symbol.
# Only specify in .Rprofile since it only takes effect on session startup.
options(vsc.globalenv = TRUE | FALSE)

# Which view column to show the plot file on graphics update
# Use FALSE to diable plot watcher so that the default R plot device is used.
# Only specify in .Rprofile since it only takes effect on session startup.
options(vsc.plot = "Two" | "Active" | "Beside" | FALSE)

# The arguments for the png device to replay user graphics to show in VSCode.
# Ignored if options(vsc.plot = FALSE).
options(vsc.dev.args = NULL | list(width = 800, height = 600))

# Which view column to show the WebView triggered by browser (e.g. shiny apps)?
# Use FALSE to open in external web browser.
options(vsc.browser = "Active" | "Beside" | "Two" | FALSE)

# Which view column to show the WebView triggered by viewer (e.g. htmlwidgets)?
# Use FALSE to open in external web browser.
options(vsc.viewer = "Two" | "Active" | "Beside" | FALSE)

# Which view column to show the WebView triggered by page_viewer (e.g. profvis)?
# Use FALSE to open in external web browser.
options(vsc.page_viewer = "Active" | "Beside" | "Two" | FALSE)

# Which view column to show the WebView triggered by View()?
# Use FALSE for R's native View(), which should be specified in .Rprofile
#   since it only takes effect on session startup.
options(vsc.view = "Two" | "Active" | "Beside" | FALSE)

# Which view column to show the WebView triggered by help panel
# (e.g. after sending `?mean` to terminal)?
# Use FALSE to disable help panel and revert to old behaviour.
options(vsc.helpPanel = "Two" | "Active" | "Beside" | FALSE)

# How much of the object to show on hover and autocomplete detail?
# As controlled by max.level arg of str().
# Use 0 (or 1) is the default - literal value or object type and dimensions
# Use 2 to show list contents, data frame columns, and example values.
options(vsc.str.max.level = 0 | 2 )

# Show object size in the workspace viewer tooltip
# The R session could become laggy if there are large character vectors in
#   objects in the global environment when this option is `TRUE`.
options(vsc.show_object_size = FALSE | TRUE)

# Use the httpgd-based plot viewer.
# Requires the R package `httpgd` to be installed.
options(vsc.use_httpgd = FALSE | TRUE)
```

The first values are the default and all subsequent values after `|` are
available choices. The `"Two" | "Active" | "Besides"` are popular values from
`ViewColumn` to specify which view column should the corresponding tab appears
in VSCode.

### How to disable it

For the case of basic usage, turning off `r.sessionWatcher` in VSCode settings
is sufficient to disable R session watcher.

For the case of advanced usage, user should, in addition, comment out or remove
the `source(...)` line appended to `~/.Rprofile`.

### How it works

- When vscode-R is activated with session watcher enabled, it deploys the
  initialization script to `~/.vscode-R/init.R`.
- vscode-R watches `~/.vscode-R/request.log` for requests from user R sessions.
- When a new R session is created, it sources `init.R` to initialize the session
  watcher and writes attach request to `~/.vscode-R/request.log`.
- vscode-R reads the attach request and knows the working directory and session
  temp directory (`{tempDir}`) of the attaching session.
- vscode-R watches `{tempDir}/vscode-R/globalenv.json` for global environment
  info and `{tempDir}/vscode-R/plot.png` for plot graphics.
- In the R session, the global environment info will be updated on each
  evaluation of top-level expression.
- When user creates or updates a plot, the `{tempDir}/vscode-R/plot.png` is
  updated, and vscode-R will open the plot file.
- When user calls `View()` with a data frame, list, environment, or any other
  object, the request is written to `~/.vscode-R/request.log` and vscode-R will
  open a WebView to show the data or open a text document to show the content of
  the object.
- When user calls the viewer (e.g. htmlwidget, provis) or browser (e.g. shiny
  app, HTML help documentation), the request is written to
  `~/.vscode-R/request.log` and vscode-R will open a WebView to present the
  viewer content.

R sessions started from the workspace root folder or a subfolder will be
automatically attached. The session watcher is designed to work in a wide range
of scenarios:

- Official R terminal or `radian` console
- R session started by vscode-R or user
- R session in a `tmux` or `screen` window
- Multiple R sessions in VSCode terminal
- Multiple R sessions in `tmux` windows or panes.
- Multi-root workspace in VSCode
- Switch between multiple running R sessions
- [Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)
  via SSH, WSL and Docker

The status bar item shows the process id of the attached R session. Click the
status bar item and it will attach to currently active session.

[radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) which is cross-platform and supports
syntax highlighting, auto-completion and many other features._
